# lock
A simple file encryption program in C++

The program requests a password and a file name then reads from the text file of your choice and writes a new C++ program that contains the file. The program then uses a system call to compile the new code and delete the original file and the new code. The new executable will rewrite the original file if the password given to the first program is entered. If an incorrect password is entered three times the executable will be deleted and the file will be lost.
